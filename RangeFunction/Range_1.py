#The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default,
# and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

# Example_1
# for x in range (6):       #Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.
#     print(x)


#Example__2

# for x in range (2,6):
#     print(x)


#Example__3

for x in range (2,20,3):          # The last 3 means difference of 3 in the loop.... and smaller than 20 .....start from 2.
    print(x)
